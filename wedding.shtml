    <h3>Wedding</h3>
    <p>The wedding will be held at 6:30 pm at <a href="http://barrenridgevineyards.com/" target="_blank">Barren Ridge  Vineyards</a> (<a href="transtrav.shtml#BR">Directions to Barren Ridge</a>) in Fishersville, VA.</p>
    <p><a href="http://barrenridgevineyards.com/" target="_blank">Barren Ridge</a> is a family-owned vineyard in the heart of the  Shenandoah Valley.  In the three years  since it opened, the winery has produced a variety of award-winning wines, some  of which we hope you will enjoy tasting at the reception.  This is also Libbyâ€™s former employer- while  living in Virginia last year, she managed the weddings and events at the  vineyard.</p>
    <p>The wedding will be out on the winery patio (weather  permitting!), overlooking the vines.</p>
    <p>The reception will follow in the winery, with drinks,  dinner, and dancing (and hopefully a lot of fun!).</p>
